I just got some disappointing news about the job I interviewed for I don't know that sounds stuff what happened they decided to go with another candidate and I really thought I had a good chance I am so sorry to hear that rejections are never easy I had my heart set on their job and I was looking forward to it is completely normal to feel sad about it you worked hard on that opportunity I know but it's hard not to feel discouraged I understand but don't give up you have a lot of potential and something better might be around the corner thank you for the support I really appreciate it your welcome you are go through setbacks and it's OK to feel sad just remember you are not alone in this
